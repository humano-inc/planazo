 *
 * 1. **Catch bugs.** Off-the-shelf rules from typescript-eslint and
 *    eslint-plugin-react-hooks. Generic; knows nothing about Planazo.
 * 2. **Enforce the conventions in AGENTS.md.** Rules written here because the
 *    convention is ours. Until this file existed those lived only as prose that
 *    every agent had to remember, and prose does not fail CI.
 *
 * Rules deliberately switched OFF are listed with the reason. A rule that is
 * off because it is wrong for this codebase is a decision; one that is off
 * because it was noisy and nobody looked is rot. Say which.
