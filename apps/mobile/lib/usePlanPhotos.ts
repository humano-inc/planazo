 * pinned to the path cache's refresh threshold in photos.ts (the query can
 * only ever serve fresher than the cache re-signs), and `refetchOnWindowFocus`
 * is switched off against the app-wide 'always' (see app/_layout.tsx), which
 * ignores staleTime by design — re-signing on every foreground would hand
 * every mounted Image a new URL and re-download the grid.
