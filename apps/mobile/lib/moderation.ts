 * they should not, and the app needs a way to stop the worst of it at the
 * door, a way for the person looking at it to tell us, and a way to shut the
 * poster out. The report goes to a queue only we can read; the block takes
 * effect in the database, not in a filter here — the shield rule (PLA-44):
 * the person you block stops seeing what you create, cannot find or contact
 * you, and no longer attends your plans, while you keep seeing them exactly
 * as before. See `is_blocked_by()` and `dissolve_block_ties()` in the
 * block_shield migration.
