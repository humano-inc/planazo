/**
 * Nineteen test files used to carry their own byte-identical
 * `jest.mock('react-native-safe-area-context', …)`, and the twentieth screen to
 * need one found out by watching its render throw. They all wanted the same
 * thing: zero insets, and SafeAreaView out of the way. So it lives here once
 * (PLA-73).
 *
 * `SafeAreaInsetsContext` defaults to `null` exactly as the real module does,
 * so a component that reads it without a provider sees what it would see on a
 * device with no provider mounted, rather than a comfortable zero.
 *
 * An inline `jest.mock` in a test file still wins over this, which is the way
 * to opt out when a test genuinely needs different insets.
