/**
 * Outbound destinations for every CTA on the site.
 *
 * `APP_STORE_URL` is the TestFlight public link for as long as Planazo is in
 * beta: there is no store listing yet, and a product page that 404s is worse
 * than an install that works. It matters most on /join, where it is the only
 * way an invited person can get the app at all, and TestFlight builds do honour
 * associated domains, so the invite still opens straight into Planazo on the
 * second tap.
 *
 * Swap it for the real listing at release. It can also be overridden by its
 * env var at build time, without a deploy of this file.
 *
 * The copy under every CTA says "beta para iOS" because of what is above.
 * `heroCtaSub`, `JOIN.ctaSub` and `META.description` in `copy.ts` move together
 * with this constant.
 *
 * @knipignore Deliberate public seam for a future /get chooser page.
